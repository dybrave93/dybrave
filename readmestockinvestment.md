Our simulation scenario is set to:
The initial funding is 10,000 yuan
Using the CSI 300 [399300] Index as a reference for index funds
In order to simplify the model, we do not consider rest days, assuming that the fixed income per trading day is one in ten thousand (about 3% per year).
At regular intervals, a “rebalance” operation is performed to restore the ratio of index funds to fixed income by 50:50.
Compare results with all purchases of index funds and all purchases of fixed income
